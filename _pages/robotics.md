This tutorial series started with an idea: [`EXPREDCO`](https://github.com/ductrivo/nextpredco), a flexible control and optimziation framework. From there, I specialize it into a class of application *Robotics Modeling, Control, and Design*, starting with planar *robot arms, then mobile robots*, and finally extending the concepts to *industrial robot* systems.

The central theme is simple:

> Control is about unleashing the full potential of a system. And to control effectively, we must first well understand that system.

That's why each module in this roadmap ends with a practical session: *from mechanical and electrical design to programming and implementation*. For example, one final project will involve building and controlling a mobile robot with an integrated robotic arm.

I hope this tutorial will be useful for anyone who wants to strengthen both their theoretical and practical skills in robotics and control system.

**Quick note:** If you're experiencing vibration or poor precision, consider looking into the system's *dynamic control*, specifically, check *the torque and speed characteristics of the motors*.

## CHAPTER 1: PLANNAR ROBOT ARMS

This chapter focuses on the **modeling, control, and simulation of planar open-chain robotic arms** composed of multiple revolute joints (N-DOF systems). The objective is to analyze both the **kinematics** and **dynamics** of these systems under various control strategies, from basic PID to advanced Model Predictive Control.

Currently, this project supports analysis of **2D planar robot arms** where the **mass of each link is assumed to be concentrated at the joints**. This simplification enables efficient and insightful study of robot behavior in both simulation and hardware implementations.
