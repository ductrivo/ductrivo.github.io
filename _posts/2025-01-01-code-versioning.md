## Semantic Versioning
[**Summary:**](https://semver.org/) Given a version number `Major.Minor.Patch`, increment the:
- `Major` version when you make incompatible API changes
- `Minor` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- `Patch` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `Major.Minor.Patch` format.

Example:
```python
# 1.0.0
def add_numbers(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c
    
# 1.0.1
def add_number(a, b, c):
    # faster and more secure :)
    ...
    
# 2.0.0
def add_numbers(a, b, c, d):
    return a + b + c + d
    
# but the version could have been 1.1.0 if the changes were non-breaking
def add_numbers(a, b, c, d = 0):
		return a + b + c + d

# pip install cool_library
add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 0)
```
