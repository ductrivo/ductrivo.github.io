# What we will learn in this course:
- Set up a professional Python development environment - Visual Studio Code, pyenv, git, autocompletion
- Make the terminal more intuitive with ZSH and plugins
- Setup automated code quality checks (testing, linting, documentation, type checking, etc.)
- Learn the professional git workflow with GitHub and CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Version and package Python software and publish it for the community


# 1. Introduction

# 2. Environment setup

# 3. Improving the terminal with ZSH

# 4. Managing multiple Python versions

## 4.1. Semantic versioning (`semver`)

**Summary:** Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.
