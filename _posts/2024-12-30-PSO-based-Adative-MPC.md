**Abstract:** This paper addresses the particularities of adaptive optimal control of the uranium extraction-scrubbing operation in the PUREX process. The process dynamics are nonlinear, high dimensional, and have limited online measurements. In addition, analysis and developments are based on a qualified simulation program called PAREX, which was validated with laboratory and industrial data. The control objective is to stabilize the process at a desired solvent saturation level, guaranteeing constraints and handling disturbances. The developed control strategy relies on optimization-based methods for computing control inputs and estimates, i.e., Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Nonlinear Moving Horizon Estimation (NMHE). The designs of these two associated algorithms are tailored for this process's particular dynamics and are implemented through an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to guarantee constraint satisfaction. Software-in-the-loop simulations using PAREX show that the designed control scheme effectively satisfies control objectives and guarantees constraints during operation.
